If I made you get interested in cybersecurity then I have accomplished my main goal. If you are interested in getting started, you've come to the right post. There are two main sources that I use in learning cybersecurity, tryhackme and hackthebox academy. These are two amazing websites that teach cybersecurity and I get most of my information from them and they are my main learning sources. There is also this amazing youtube channel called 'networkchuck' he is AMAZING. He taught me a lot of things in cybersecurity and he inspired me to make this website. You need to go check him out. I'll link all these sources and more at the bottom of this post.

Promise me that you will go and check out these three sources and learning something new from them. Believe me, they are amazing sources to learn from. Don't forget that when learning new commands always check the man(manual) page for more useful information about the command you are using. If you ever need any help from me just send me an email at `youssof.live@gmail.com`
