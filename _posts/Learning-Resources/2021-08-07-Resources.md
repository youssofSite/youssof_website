I promised you that I would make a document containing all the resources that I use for learning cybersecurity right, so instead of creating a seperate document and adding all the sources there I decided to just include it on the website to make it more convinient for you to see them. These are the sources I used to get started in cybersecurity, hacking, and networking.
