Hi, my name is Youssof. I am a 14 year old boy, and soon to be 15. I was born in Egypt. I love technology and I love learning new things about it. I figured if I created a website and share my knowledge with other people and make it accessible to anyone in the world. I would make a change in someone else's life for the better.
