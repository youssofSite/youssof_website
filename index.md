  Just another website - You may find something useful, so stick around.

This is where I will share my projects and ideas. So you can think of this as a portfolio and blog at the same time. You can find all posts in the 'Posts' tab. If you have any questions feel free to contact me, the contact page is down below.

{% include button.html text="Github" color="#0466d6"  icon="github" link="https://github.com/Youssof2025" %}

You can visit my github page as I have projects written in C. You can go check them out. I have a lot of experience with C and C++ but i'm not an expert at them yet. If you need basic help with them I'm just an email away. Soon I'll add a 'buy me a coffee' link so that you can support me, it's completely optional.

<!--# Why did I create this website?

I created this website so that I can share my journey with others, you never know who it might help. It could even change many lives. Which is the main goal of this website, to inspire others and make a change to another person's life for the better. Also, a website on a person's resume is pretty good and it could increase their chances of being hired, I'm only 14 but it could help me in the future.-->
